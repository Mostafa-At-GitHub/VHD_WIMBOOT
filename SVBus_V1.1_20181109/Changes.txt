--------------

- TrueCrypt V7.1a full system disk encryption is now supported
  SVBus V1.0 was not working in combination with TrueCrypt V7.1a full system disk
  encryption. We changed the way SVBus V1.1 searches the GRUB4DOS signature string.
  If we can not find the GRUB4DOS signature inside the actual INT13 handler we try
  to search the entire 640 KB RAM area. This way we can even detect the GRUB4DOS
  loader if INT13 got hooked by another program.
